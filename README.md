# aaToolbox Manager
aaToolbox Manager is a program I made to host all downloads and resources for my projects. I found it much more efficient (and sometimes cost/time-effective) to go with this method rather than just hosting it all in a website. This was inspired by Creative Cloud's and Visual Studio's own installers, and is one of my first major C++ projects, as I am willing to drive away from the dependency of Electron (which uses Chromium, yuck!) to host it.

This project was fully developed with Win32 as a start, with plans to potentially rewrite in Qt once I figure out how the whole shenanigans work and feel more confident in using it for future C++ projects. This was completely written in VSCode.
